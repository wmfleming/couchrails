# Rails On Couchbase

A Rails Project providing a base rails setup integrated and optimized for CouchBase.


## Requirements (at the time of writing.)

1. ruby - 1.9.3p194
2. rubygem - 1.8.23
3. libcouchbase - 1.1.0dp


Note: as we will be using couchbase-model 0.1.0, it has a dependency for couchbase ~> 1.2.0.dp.  That version of couchbase requires the libcouchbase 1.1.0dp version.  As of 05/29/2012, I have been unable to get this to work on my macbook as I use homebrew to install libcouchbase and the most current version I can find is 1.0.2

## Usage

More coming soon.  The primary goal of this project is to provide a good well-documented solid foundational rails application configured to use couchbase.  As I am very new to rails programming, I welcome all the help I can get.  Remember this is for newbies to learn from and use as a platform to start their rails development.
